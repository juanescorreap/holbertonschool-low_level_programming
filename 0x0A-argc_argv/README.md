# 0x0A. C - argc, argv

Project developed by Juan Esteban Correa PÃ©rez as part of the foundations program at Holberton School.

It's purpose is to help the student understand:

How to use arguments passed to your program  
What are two prototypes of main that you know of, and in which case do you use one or the other  
How to use __attribute__((unused)) or (void) to compile functions with unused variables or parameters
